# Project: 0x18. Webstack monitoring

## Concepts

For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

- [Monitoring](./concepts/monitoring.md)
- [Server](./concepts/server.md)

![web_monitoring](./concepts/web_monitoring.png)

## Background Context

‚ÄúYou cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure‚Äù is a famous saying in the Tech industry. In the age of the data-ism, monitoring how our Software systems are doing is an important thing. In this project, we will implement one of many tools to measure what is going on our servers.

Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:

- Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected
- Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)

- What are error logs for a web server (such as Nginx)

## Tasks

0. [Sign up for Datadog and install datadog-agent](./README.md) :

For this task head to [https://www.datadoghq.com/](https://www.datadoghq.com/) and sign up for a free `Datadog` account. When signing up, you‚Äôll have the option of selecting statistics from your current stack that `Datadog` can monitor for you. Once you have an account set up, follow the instructions given on the website to install the `Datadog` agent.

- Sign up for Datadog - **Please make sure you are using the US website of Datagog (https://app.datadoghq.com)**
- Also,üôèüèΩmake sure to use the US1 East region. EAST!!!
- Use the US1 region
- Install `datadog-agent` on `web-01`
- Create an `application key` (see this [link](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/))
- Copy-paste in your Intranet user profile (here) your DataDog `API key` and your DataDog `application key`.
- Your server `web-01` should be visible in Datadog under the host name `XX-web-01`
  - You can validate it by using this [API](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/hosts/)
  - If needed, you will need to update the hostname of your server

Hopefully when done right, you should have something like this in your web-server:

```sh
ubuntu@user-web-01:~$ curl -X GET "https://api.datadoghq.com/api/v1/hosts" -H "Accept: application/json" -H "DD-API-KEY: <your-API-key>" -H "DD-APPLICATION-KEY: <your-APPLICATION-key>"

1. [Monitor some metrics](./README.md) :

Among the litany of data your monitoring service can report to you are system metrics. You can use these metrics to determine statistics such as reads/writes per second, which can help your company determine if/how they should scale. Set up some monitors within the Datadog dashboard to monitor and alert you of a few. You can read about the various system metrics that you can monitor here: [System Check](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/system/).

- Set up a monitor that checks the number of read requests issued to the device per second.
- Set up a monitor that checks the number of write requests issued to the device per second.

2. [Create a dashboard](./2-setup_datadog) :

Now create a dashboard with different metrics displayed in order to get a few different visualizations.

- Create a new `dashboard`
- Add at least 4 `widgets` to your dashboard. They can be of any type and monitor whatever you‚Äôd like
- Create the answer file `2-setup_datadog` which has the `dashboard_id` on the first line. Note: in order to get the id of your dashboard, you may need to use [Datadog‚Äôs API](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/?lang=python#get-all-dashboards)

- Go to the Datadog dashboard.
- Navigate to the 'Dashboards' section.
- Click on 'New Dashboard.'
- Add at least 4 widgets with different metrics. For example:
  - Widget 1: Metric Time Series for CPU Usage 
  - Widget 2: Top List for Most Active Processes
  - Widget 3: Heatmap for Disk I/O Operations
  - Widget 4: Line Graph for Network Traffic

- Save the dashboard.

Then you can get your id and dashboards from the command line like:

```sh
ubuntu@user-web-01:~$ curl -X GET "https://api.datadoghq.com/api/v1/dashboard" -H "Accept: application/json" -H "DD-API-KEY: <YOUR_API_KEY>" -H "DD-APPLICATION-KEY: <YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY>"
{"dashboards":[{"id":"guq-qgy-ktj","title":"Ayomide's Dashboard Wed, Feb 14. 11:46pm","description":null,"layout_type":"ordered","url":"/dashboard/guq-qgy-ktj/ayomides-dashboard-wed-feb-14-1146pm","is_read_only":false,"created_at":"2024-02-14T22:47:20.653515+00:00","modified_at":"2024-02-14T22:50:24.573828+00:00","author_handle":"ayomidekay7@gmail.com","deleted_at":null}]}
ubuntu@user-web-01:~$
```
